# PubMed Literature Skimmer

**PubMed Literature Skimmer** is a Chrome extension designed to streamline the process of reading and analyzing PubMed abstracts. It extracts abstracts from PubMed articles, processes them using a machine learning model, and reformats them with bold headings for better readability.

---

## Features

- Extracts abstracts from PubMed articles.
- Processes abstracts using a Flask server and a machine learning model.
- Reformats abstracts with bold headings (`BACKGROUND`, `OBJECTIVE`, `METHODS`, `RESULTS`, `CONCLUSIONS`).
- Ensures the extension runs only once per page load.
- User-friendly UI with a button to trigger the extraction process.
